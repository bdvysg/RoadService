# Course Project Repository - Road Service 
## Overview
This repository contains the course project for the Object-Oriented Design course at Odessa Politechnic National University. The project is a road service automation system developed using .NET, SQLite for database management, and implementing design patterns such as Unit of Work and Repository. The system is designed to streamline the process of managing road maintenance tasks, equipment inventory, material tracking, and worker payroll.

## Features
- Task Management: Create and manage tasks for road maintenance work.
- Equipment Tracking: Keep track of the available equipment used for road maintenance.
- Material Inventory: Maintain an inventory of materials required for various tasks.
- Estimating and calculating cost of every task.
  
## Technologies Used
- .NET: The core framework used for developing the application.
- SQLite: Database management system for storing and retrieving data efficiently.
  
## Design Patterns
- Unit of Work: Ensures that a series of operations are performed on the database as a single unit, ensuring consistency.
- Repository: Abstracts the data access layer, providing a clean separation between the business logic and data access code.
